        "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that attacks the immune system.  If left untreated, most people will develop Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS).  HIV can be transmitted sexually, through exposure to infected blood, or from a mother to her child during pregnancy, birth, or while breastfeeding.  Current HIV tests look for antibodies (cells produced by the body to fight off the virus) and antigens (proteins found on the surface of the HIV virus) in your blood.  These tests can detect HIV earlier than tests that look only for antibodies.",

        "A negative HIV test means that you do not have HIV.  If you believe that you could have recently been exposed to HIV, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that you repeat this test 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after the last potential exposure to confirm that you have not been infected."

This can cause blindness, seizures, and problems with formation of a baby’s arms and legs before birth.",

If you do not have evidence of immunity using the above criteria, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends two varicella vaccines at least 28 days apart.  Repeat testing after vaccination is not routinely recommended.",
