    question: " Who should get preconception testing?",
    answer: ["Any woman who desires to become pregnant in the next 12 months."]

  {
    question: " When should I get preconception testing?",
    answer: [
      "We recommend starting the preconception journey 12 months before you desire to become pregnant. This will allow you time to correct any abnormalities that might be detected on your tests (which can take 3-6 months, in some cases). This way you’ll be in your best health when you’re ready to start trying."

    question:
      " Isn’t it early to start planning for a pregnancy 12 months before I want to become pregnant?",
    answer: [
      "Not at all!  Think about how much of your life you may have spent trying to prevent pregnancy.  It only makes sense that planning for a pregnancy deserves some time and attention as well!  Many of the tests that are included in preconception care can detect abnormalities that can be corrected before pregnancy (that’s the beauty of preconception testing!).  But, in order to be able to correct these abnormalities, you need to give yourself time to do so!  By completing your tests early, you give yourself the space and time you need to change your lifestyle, start taking a medication, or find an experienced healthcare provider to help you on your journey."

    question:
      " Why do I need preconception testing?  Won’t my provider test for everything at my first prenatal visit?",
    answer: [
      "The number one goal of preconception testing is to prevent complications in a future pregnancy.  By addressing abnormalities before you become pregnant, you can make changes that can improve your health and your future baby’s health.  In comparison, the main goal of prenatal testing (i.e. testing when you’re already pregnant) is to diagnose problems during a pregnancy.  While some of these problems can be corrected during pregnancy, the best time to make these changes is before your baby starts to grow (this means before you become pregnant!).  Imagine how empowering it would be to start a pregnancy armed with this information…who wouldn’t want that?"

    question:
      " My provider said preconception testing isn’t important?  What should I do?",
    answer: [
      "Unfortunately, many providers are still not aware of the benefits of preconception testing, and even the ones who are may not know which tests to recommend.  As a matter of fact, this is one of the reasons why our co-founder, Kristy, started PreConception!  So many of her patients had seen other providers before their pregnancy but were not given the appropriate tests or information they needed (and deserved!).  This resulted in them learning about preventable medical problems after conception.  After seeing woman after woman repeat this same story, she knew something had to change (see her story here!). (hyperlink “here” to “Our Story” page) As the first (and only!) online service to provide women with direct access to preconception testing without having to schedule a doctor’s appointment, we feel so fortunate to be able to offer you access to these tests through PreConception.  We hope this empowers you to seek out the information you deserve so that you don’t have to go from doctor to doctor searching for someone who has experience in preconception care.  No more waiting for an appointment.  No more disappointing conversations.  No surprise insurance bills.  Just the information you need, available at your fingertips whenever you decide to start your pregnancy planning journey."

    question:
      " I don’t have any medical problems; do I need preconception testing?",
    answer: [
      "Yes!  Preconception testing is recommended for everyone!  While certain tests may be more important for women with a personal or family history of certain medical conditions, the tests offered by PreConception are appropriate for anyone!"
    ]
  },
  {
    question: " Will I need to have these tests again once I’m pregnant?",
    answer: [
      "This will depend on many factors including whether your tests are normal or abnormal, when you become pregnant, and if you’ve had any changes in your medical history since you had testing done.  Most women will have at least some of these tests repeated during the first trimester of pregnancy.  For example, pregnancy may change the results of a CBC so repeating these tests during early pregnancy may help your provider determine whether you’ve had any pregnancy-related changes.  Other tests — such as rubella or varicella immunity and genetic carrier screening — are unlikely to need to be repeated if they’re normal because they don’t usually change over time.  It’s important to have an ongoing conversation with your healthcare provider before, during, and after pregnancy to ensure that you receive the care that is best for you.  To help with this, we’ll send your PreConception test results (with your permission) to the provider of your choice at no charge! (Coming soon)"
    ]
  },
  {
    question: " When should I repeat my preconception tests?",
    answer: [
      "If any of your initial preconception tests were abnormal, you may want to consider repeating those tests after making the recommended changes.  This will ensure that these tests are normal before you become pregnant (which is the ultimate goal!).  Repeat testing should also occur under the following circumstances",

      "• After a miscarriage or stillbirth, before attempting to conceive again.",
      "•	After a healthy pregnancy, before trying for another pregnancy.",
      "•	If you’re not pregnant but it’s been more than 12 months since you’ve had preconception testing.",
      "•	After any change in your personal or family health history.",
      "We do not limit the number of tests you’re allowed to order at PreConception; however, your healthcare provider may be able to determine whether repeat testing is recommended for your specific situation.  This is why we offer the option to send your results directly to your provider using your personalized PreConception Portal!  Just enter your provider’s information and we’ll send them your personalized results document, as well as a copy of your report from Quest.  This way you and your provider can review your test results together and discuss which ones may be appropriate to repeat!"

  },
  {
    question: " Are preconception tests the same as fertility tests?",

    answer: [
      "  No!  Preconception tests are tests that are recommended before you try to become pregnant.  Preconception tests are recommended for everyone.  Fertility tests are tests that are typically only recommended if you’re having difficulty becoming pregnant.  Fertility tests are not recommended for everyone.  While abnormalities in some preconception tests (such as TSH and vitamin D) may decrease your chances of becoming pregnant (and therefore affect your fertility), these tests are not typically considered fertility tests.  With that said, if an abnormality discovered by one of these tests is corrected, it may improve your chances of becoming pregnant!"

    question:
      " I’m planning to use an egg donor, gestational carrier, and/or sperm donor — is preconception testing still recommended?",

    answer: [
      " Yes!  There are certain abnormalities detected through preconception testing that can affect the health of your eggs and/or your uterus.  If you’re planning to use an egg donor (using someone else’s eggs) but carry the pregnancy yourself (using your uterus), your health affects the health of your pregnancy just as much as a woman who becomes pregnant with her own eggs. If you’re planning on using your eggs, but a gestational carrier (also known as a surrogate) will be carrying the pregnancy, preconception tests should be performed on the gestational carrier before an embryo transfer and on yourself before an egg retrieval.  Abnormalities in certain tests have recently been shown to affect egg quality.  Correcting these levels before you have an egg retrieval may improve the number of high-grade embryos that are produced.  In fact, many of these tests are REQUIRED by state or federal law before you can have procedures such as IVF (in vitro fertilization)."

  //   question: " Why is genetic carrier screening recommended before pregnancy?",
  //   answer: [
  //     "Prevention is the hallmark of preconception care, and genetic carrier screening is no exception to this.  The average woman does not find out she’s pregnant until she is at least 5-6 weeks pregnant.  (hyperlink this sentence to this source https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5269518/.Most women do not have their first prenatal visit until they’re at least 8 weeks pregnant.  In fact, 1 out of 6 women are not seen for their first visit until the second trimester!  (hyperlink this sentence with https://www.marchofdimes.org/Peristats/ViewTopic.aspx?reg=99&top=5&lev=0&slev=1)It often takes 2 weeks to get genetic carrier screening results, and if they’re positive, a woman’s partner is then tested (that means another 2 weeks for results).  Assuming genetic carrier screening was offered at the first prenatal visit (unfortunately this does not always occur), most women are at least 12 weeks pregnant before they know if their child is at risk of having one of these genetic conditions.  Imagine the anxiety that adds to a pregnancy! Having this information before pregnancy allows you (and your partner) to make an informed decision about your future pregnancy plans.  This may include having your partner tested to find out if he carries the same gene you do, speaking with a genetic counselor to determine the risk to your future pregnancy, having early testing of your baby to determine if they carry this gene, or using preimplantation testing to avoid having a child with a certain genetic condition.  Testing before pregnancy allows you to enter pregnancy already armed with this information.  It means that you’re not just along for the ride, you’re driving the car!  How empowering is that?"

  // {
  //   question:
  //     " Do I need to have genetic carrier screening again if I’ve had this test previously?",
  //   answer: [
  //     "That depends on which test(s) you’ve had before.  We’ve chosen to partner with Invitae (hyperlink name to www.invitae.com) because they offer one of the largest genetic carrier screening panels available today.  If you’ve had genetic carrier screening previously, it’s important to know which genes you’ve had tested.  If you’ve had a smaller panel previously (which many women have) but want more information now, you can order one of the packages offered through our partnership with Invitae."
  //   ]

  // {
  //   question:
  //     " Why is genetic carrier screening not included in PreConception’s test package?",
  //   answer: [
  //     "Whether or not to have genetic testing is a very personal decision.  Unlike other preconception tests, genetic carrier screening is not a test that needs to be repeated before each pregnancy (your genes aren’t changing!).  We offer genetic testing separately from our current test package so that you can choose whether you want to have it.  We hope this empowers you to make the decision that’s best for you and your family."

  //   answer: [
  //     "Genetic testing is a personal decision, but the short answer is yes, you should still have access to these tests so that you can make the best decision for yourself and your family.  The majority of couples at risk of having a child with a genetic disorder have no family history of that condition.  In fact, research shows that we each carry an average of one to two genetic mutations (hyperlink https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/04/150408100522.htm to underlined words) that can cause severe genetic disorders or prenatal death if two copies of the same mutation are inherited by a child."

  // },
  // {
  //   question: "What happens if my genetic test is positive?",
  //   answer: [
  //     "One of the many reasons PreConception has partnered with Invitae to provide genetic carrier screening is because they have an amazing support system ready for you to use if you test positive for any of the genetic conditions they screen for (at no additional cost to you).  When you receive your results from Invitae, you’ll also receive information on how you can speak with a genetic counselor.  Genetic counselors are professionals who have specialized education in genetics and counseling.  They can help you understand what your results mean, how these results could affect a future pregnancy, and what options you have moving forward.  You can schedule a phone consult with one of Invitae’s genetic counselors at a time that is best for you or you can call and request to speak with the next available genetic counselor that same day. In most cases, they will recommend that your partner also have a genetic test to determine if they have the same abnormal gene(s) that you do.  In many cases, if your partner does not have the gene that you tested positive for, then the risk of your child having the genetic condition is minimal.  A genetic counselor can help you understand more about this."

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) defines medical expenses as “the costs of diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease…[including] payments for legal medical services rendered by physicians and other medical practitioners.”  Because our test packages are ordered by board-certified physicians, and your test results can help you and your healthcare provider diagnose an underlying medical problem that may affect a future pregnancy, these tests are eligible for use of HSA/FSA funds.  A receipt may be requested by the organization that manages your funds, so we recommend keeping a copy!  You can use the receipt we emailed you or you can access your receipt directly through your PreConception Portal!"
